Description		: A small Quake 3 deathmatch map.  The item balance is
			  probably best while using CPM, and there are a few
			  shortcuts, but it's not really a CPM map.  It's more
			  of a vanilla Quake 3 tournament and small-sided FFA
			  map.
			  

			  The map uses textures from Lunaran's abandoned
			  Quake 3 single player project named Coriolis Force.
			  This particular set was intended for the deep
			  underground bases that were unaffected by the harsh
			  weather on the surface.  This map obviously is not
			  deep underground, so I made a calmer and more
			  friendly environment.  All the textures included
			  are by Lunaran, except for rpgskyback.jpg and
			  rpgskyfront.jpg, which I created from photosource.
			  I got the photosource from this website:

Additional credits	: id Software, and Lunaran for textures.
