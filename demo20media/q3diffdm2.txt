Construction:	Enjoy The Silence is my second level. I tried to make
		the gameplay more compact and intense compared to my
		first map q3diffdm1. The athmosphere in q3diffdm2 is
		very different too, dark, ambient, moody. A slight
		quake2 feeling =)
		Built from scratch with QuArK 6.3 using the q3map2
		compiler.
		Levelshot created in Photoshop 7.
		The construction of the map took roughly 6-7 weeks
		including beta testing.

Thanks:		Thank you all who helped me beta test this map. Special
		mentions go out to StormShadow ,bL[][][]d and Hex,
		but everyone at Burial-Grounds deserve a big thanks!
		I love you guys, you are the best!
		Thank you idSoftware for making Quake and thank you
		Depeche Mode for inspiring me and making me happy =)
